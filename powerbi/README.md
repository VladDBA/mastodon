# Finding our community members on Mastodon

This repo contains importable CSV files with the Mastodon addresses of the Power BI and Azure Synapse communities on Mastodon. It has been compiled using **only publicly available** information.

If you'd like to be included, please add your Mastodon address to your Twitter name, username, bio or pinned Tweet. Then follow any one of these accounts and it'll be added to the CSV around midnight GMT.
