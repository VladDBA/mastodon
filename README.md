# Finding our community members on Mastodon

This repo contains importable CSV files with the Mastodon addresses of Data Platform, PowerShell and Power BI Twitter communities on Mastodon. It has been compiled using only publicly available information.

If you'd like to be included, please add your Mastodon address to your name, username, bio or pinned Tweet and it'll be added to the CSV around midnight GMT.

This project has a lot of possiblities and this is just a preview of what's to come.

# We need help!

Any JavaScript programmers available? We need to smash the Mastodon CSV files with Twitter CSV files to let people see, select, and export a filtered CSV if they wish. The Twitter CSV contains links to the person's profile pic (along with name, username, etc) so that could be used to make it easier for people to identify their Twitter friends.

It would be even cooler to allow them to specify their Mastodon server then automatically make Follow buttons that let them just go down the list and add who they want with the click of a button.

Maybe it could even ask for their API and check to see if they're already freinds and that follow button would be grayed out.

We could put all of this online using GitHub Pages.

# Importing your CSV files

To import the files, do this: (Coming soon, gotta publish this repo to get some links)
